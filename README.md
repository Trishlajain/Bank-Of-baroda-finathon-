Run by simple php webserver apache or others

# ChatBot
It's an script for sending messege on facebook we can message public users from this script and make them aware about our chatbot chatbot can also target specific group we scrape like we did in facebook scrapper if facebook scraper scrape for startupindia page we can get various public users they also have some startup or idea so we can message them our specific product for startups.


# Idea 

Our idea was to get maximum potential users for loan. To find potential users we thought to use SNS that is Social Networking Site.
We made a chatbot that can message the users through all the SNS and get their details using scrapping the datas and then with the data we can determine whether he/she can return the loan money as soon as he can so that we can invest that money in other user inorder to increse financial income.

we even got selected for the last second round.
